## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

This project will be a website where users can view various Native American accessories and jewelery. The website will feature a page of an image gallery of museum pieces from the Eiteljorg Museum. The images will be Native American jewelery such as necklaces, bracelets, etc. This website will also feature an interactive Native American jewelery maker. I chose this project topic because during the field trip, I saw some pieces on display that featured a lot of Native American accessories and jewelery, I also saw some pieces that I did not expect to see such as a pair of sunglasses and a perfume bottle. These unorthodox items inspired me to create a website where people can design their own Native American themed accessories and jewelery, creating a fun way to bridge technology, creativity, and history

### Core Webpages

- **Home Page** - A standard home page where users will be greeted with the options to either go to the image gallery or to the jewelery maker

- **Image Gallery** - This page will feature various images of museum artifacts from the Eiteljorg Museum, primarily the pieces of Native American jewelery they have on display.

- **Jewelery Maker** - This interactive page will be where the user will be able to design their own pieces of Native American jewelery. Users will be able to choose from a base form, either a necklace, earings, bracelet, or even a pair of sunglasses. Then, they will be able to choose from various different patterns to apply to their design. Finally, they will then be able to choose from different colors. These patterns and colors will be related to Native American culture.

### Design Choices

This webstie will feature a color theme that closely follows Native American culture.

**Colors**

- `#BA6573` - _Red_
- `#D8A37B` - _Orange_
- `#F2D496` - _Yellow_
- `#788265` - _Green_
- `#393C57` - _Blue_

All of the colors used will be selectable by the user in the Jewelery Maker page.

**Data Structure**

For the data structure, local storage will be used for the Jewelery Maker page. Users will be able to save their designs. The design will be uploaded to local storage, following the structure:

`{"base": "sunglasses", "pattern": "quilt", "color": "red" }`

This will be a simple way to store the designs each person has created.
