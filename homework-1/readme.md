## Assignment 1:Git Readme

### Websites vs Web apps

The difference between websites and web apps is that websites are primarily focused on displaying information, while web apps are primarily focused on task interactions. For example, an example of a website would be Wikipedia. Wikipedia displays information and is meant to be browsed. Where as an example of a web app would be Google Slides. Google Slides is interactive as you can create and design slideshows on the site.

### VS Code & Extensions

VS Code is the application we will be using to code for this course. There are three extensions that are needed for the course:

-Prettier: This extension formats your code correctly
-Live Server: This extension allows you to launch a live server
-Auto Rename Tag: When you rename a tag, this extension will automatically rename the paired tag.

There are also two other extension that are not required but can be very helpful:

-Code Spell Checker: This extension will spell check your code

-vscode-pets: This extension adds pets into VS Code for moral support

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

Version Control is a way to manage, track, and organize different version and changes in your code. Git is a type of version control tool, it is what we will use in this course. Git allows us to easily collaborate with people. GitHub is a website where we can store Git repositories. GitHub is a website that is used a lot in the industry.

### Markdown & Documentation

Markdown is a markup language that easily converts plain text into HTML. It is used opposed to writing complex HTML tags to create structure. Markdown is used for documentation in this course in our readme files. Markdown is also used widely in the industry, and many platforms like Reddit and Github support Markdown.
