This is used for understanding program flow & tracking variables.

`console.warn("This is a console.warn")`
This displays warnings in the console. It is used to highlight issues without halting the program.

`console.error("This is a console.error")`
This displays errors in the console. It is used to identify critical issues that need attention ASAP.

#### Inline vs. External Scripts

Inline scripts are written directly in the HTML file using the `<script></script>` tag. It is convenient for quick testing when minimal code is required.

External scripts are stored in a `.js` file separate from the main HTML file. It is linked to the HTML using the `<script></script>` tag with a `src` attribute. External scripts are favorable when working on large projects as it promotes clean code structure and readability.
