## Week 3

### Weekly Recap

### Variables

In JS, there are three main ways to declare a variable. These ways are:

- `var` - This should be avoided. Do not use. It can be reassigned and redeclared.
- `let` - This is block-scoped. It can be reassigned, although it cannot be redeclared in the same scope.
- `const` - This is block-scoped. It cannot be reassigned or redeclared.

You should use `let` if you might need to reassign the variable later on, but if you need the variable to not change, then use `const`

### Object Wrappers

- String objects allow for text manipulation and analyzing text.
- Number objects are used to perform calculations and conversions
- Boolean objects are for checking or converting values
